<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

![image](https://github.com/lezhou8/it-project-team-34/assets/108723117/461a4c3b-15d2-471d-8f0f-a840372bd856)
The goal of the **Weconnect CIT** project is to develop and implement a simple user application and a corresponding web-based administration tool for Volunteering Victoria and its associated parties. The user application will empower volunteers associated with Volunteering Victoria to participate in surveys, while the web app will provide administrators with valuable insights and statistics derived from these surveys. By building these components, we aim to facilitate efficient data collection, analysis, and decision-making to enhance the impact of volunteering efforts.

*Key Features of the Volunteer Tool:*
- Receive an email with a temporary password upon volunteer registration.
- Be able to securely update and change a users password.
- Take surveys to reflect on progress.
- Automatically receive mobile notifications to complete pending surveys to be completed (IN PROGRESS).

*Key Features of the Administration Tool:*
- View aggregate changes in survey results for an organisation.
- Slice data by theme, date, and specific questions.
- Register new volunteers to an organisation and Volunteering Victoria.
